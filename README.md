Earlier is an example of this kind of practise which acoustic ecologist like (name) and others further developed in 1970s contemporary practisioners include Akio suzuki who is the guy in the middle with the cap on , who since the mid 1990s developed a project he called Oto date or listen point so he will tour in particular cities invited for a festival or somthing tour in particular city and spray paint this little logo  right this logo that looks like somewhere a combination between ears and footprints right, on particular spots that he finds intresting and he just invite people to.. you know walk through this particular city space and listen at those particular spots and of course the way that the sound happened when he happened to be there is not necessarily what you will encounter if you’re there. Another very different practice is a practice done by Christina Kubisch who is a german sound artist to into 2003 started to do this project she called electrical walks, she was doing installations with this kind of boxes that would register the translator electro acoustic signals as sound right .. so in a particular city all sort of things so  any sort of electrical phenomenon at all will produce an electro magnetic field around it right that electro magnetic field can be registered as sound right.. Has to be transdused and so se had a set of headphones design that would do this and of so go to particular city a project i did with her in 2006 in a kitchen where she mapped out a particular area of Chelsea near the kitchen and mark points that she found particular intresting , nobody i knew actually followed this becouse when you have these things on it becomes this really kind of cool scavenger hunt where you look for cool sounds all sorts of things makes sound that you would never imagine , right so ATM machines not the most visualy exciting things in the history of the world are turn out  to be super intrestring, from the sound, ill play you a couple of exorbs one of her favorite thing is security gates between theft prevantion things, so this is one of them and its like minimum techno if you’re in to that kind of thing which i am, so this is a security gate in Oxford (sound playing) so imagine you know insert to tour a city and you serve like check out .. You know Barnys security gate is super boring but the.. Whatever but CVS is facinating so anyway people look at you very strangely too when you have these things on couse youre doing weird things and you are now quite sure what you doing , so this is a subway in Taipei (sound playing) sound that are taken directly to the recorder .. Ill play just to give a sense.. This is from a post office in Bremen,Germany and she says i have no idea what was making that noise (sound playing) so two quick things before , sorry i have been a bit too long so another important sonic practise is to think about sound politicly think about the politics of sound and how the sound imobilaze to political and probably the group of artists that have the most sustained investigation of this is collective ultra red who formed in Los Angeles  by a bunch of duo that quicky became broad of group of Age acitivists , and the group anitionaly made recordings they were kind of known experimental electronic circuits as people record these they would often record protests and cooprate this to electronic music and quickly they begun to change  to alter their practise , in 2006 they primerly dedicated themselves to what they call the politics of silence and listening in public space, so they are inspired very much by John Cage who furied them is important  as  quick composer but also as a figure who really tried to think of sound and listening in a kind of social setting  they call what they do militant sound of investigation and they describe what they do as exploring acoustic space as inansiative of social relations so via this sight and community specific they would engage  a particular place and pose a particular question and have a set of discussions often just you know these flipped boards and they just write down ideas , and the black things you see on the wall are what they call protocols for listening they have some listening sessions or a sound walk , they invite people to the space they invite people to gather sounds from their particular spaces that they were walking  through and bring  sounds there and they will play these publicly with a very indeterminate question : what did you hear?and their  thought was like no right or wrong answer, just what did you hear and they pose questions like what is the sound of freedom what is the sound of antiracism what is the sound of war and the poor and they would use them as a way to try to think about sound how sound is activates on these contexts freedom antiracicm and the war and the poor and also how we might think of it otherwise, Dont Rhine who is one of the founders right said  cage the idea was that the composer is not composing sounds but its composing  ways of listening. You are organising listening so the sound artist organisies sound as a political strategy. If we’re going to take that seriously then organises are already involved in aesthetic operations. So its not so much bringing art into social situations but rather reading social situations  as very much involved with the aesthetic. Another project is a project a set of political project.. There are many i just choose a couple  Is a project by Jordanian artist Lawrence Abu Hamdan who describes shes project as forensing listening and what that means is that she pays close attention to the ways that sound is employed in legal context and often invlolving human rights.
